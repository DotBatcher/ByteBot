# ByteBot
A simple bot with the ability to kick, ban, and turn off.


to setup: make a discord app and bot user, 
make a folder for your bot to be in, 
install node.js onto the folder, 
move the bot.js file onto the folder (i recommend putting it in a seperate folder inside the bot folder to easily run it.), 
make a file called ".env", 
in the .env file enter: DISCORDJS_BOT_TOKEN=[your bot token here], 
find the line of code that says "let isBotOwner = message.author.id == '743153101803880543';", 
replace the numbers with your discord user id (settings > appearance > developer mode, right click your profile and click copy id), 
invite the bot. 
run the code with the node command, 
you should be set.
